# VERDANT
intelligent, automated system that monitors and manages the environmental variables of an indoor vertical farming setup in real-time. The platform should collect sensor data, automate routine agricultural tasks, and provide actionable, data-driven insights to help users maximize crop yield while strictly minimizing water and electricity usage. 
SmartCrop AI: Precision Autonomous Farming
An AI-driven ecosystem that replicates "perfect" growing conditions using real-time sensor data and automated climate control.

💡 The Problem
Farmers and indoor growers struggle to maintain the "perfect" environment for sensitive crops. Fluctuations in pH, temperature, or humidity can lead to wasted electricity (AC over-usage), water waste, and lower crop yields. Traditional monitoring requires constant manual adjustment.

🚀 The Solution: The "Replicate" Engine
SmartCrop AI doesn't just monitor; it learns and mimics.

Sensor Fusion: Tracks Temperature, pH, Humidity, and Water Usage via IoT sensors.

AI Scoring: Our Machine Learning model compares current tray data against optimal plant profiles in Firebase.

The 95% Rule: If a tray hits a "Perfect Match" score (>95/100), the AI automatically captures those parameters as a "Replicate" and triggers the AC, Watering, and LED systems to maintain that exact state.

✨ Key Features
Tray-Specific Management: Assign specific crops (e.g., Strawberry, Lettuce) to individual trays (Tray A, Tray B) via the app.

Autonomous Automation: Real-time control of LED lights, AC, and irrigation based on AI scoring.

Daily Trend Analytics: Interactive charts showing crop health trends and environmental stability.

Smart Alerts & Sustainability: Push notifications alert users if sensors detect anomalies (e.g., "AC inefficiency detected") to prevent crop damage and energy waste.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native / Flutter (Cross-platform Mobile App)

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Backend & Database: Firebase (Real-time Database & Authentication)

AI/ML Logic: Python (Scikit-Learn / TensorFlow) hosted via FastAPI

IoT Integration:  Raspberry pi for sensor data transmission

⚙️ How It Works (The Logic Flow)
Input: User assigns "Strawberry" to Tray A.

Sensing: Sensors send data (24°C, 6.5 pH) to the Firebase backend.

Analysis: The AI compares this to the "Optimal Strawberry Profile."

Action: If the score is high, the system locks in the parameters. If the temp is too high, the AI sends a command to the AC and notifies the user via the app.
